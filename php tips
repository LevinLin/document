1. ‘Class DOMDocument not found’ error when using phpQuery
  [reason]
  it probably means that you tried to create a DOMDocument while your PHP installation doesn’t have support for manipulating XML Documents using the DOM tree, or performing XSL transformations on XML documents.
  
  [solution]
  In Fedora/CentOS, you can solve this by installing the XML module for PHP by executing the following command as root:
  [1] yum install php-xml
  [2] reload httpd/php
