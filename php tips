1. ‘Class DOMDocument not found’ error when using phpQuery
  [reason]
  it probably means that you tried to create a DOMDocument while your PHP installation doesn’t have support for manipulating XML Documents using the DOM tree, or performing XSL transformations on XML documents.
  
  [solution]
  In Fedora/CentOS, you can solve this by installing the XML module for PHP by executing the following command as root:
  [1] yum install php-xml
  [2] reload httpd/php
  
2. "400 Bad Request" when "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"
  [1] You are sending an HTTP/1.1 request, according to the RFC it must include a "host" header, so it should be something like this:
      GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
      Host: my-ip.herokuapp.com\r\n
      ...\r\n
      \r\n
  [2] If you wish to avoid sending "Host: ...", then you should send "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n", but not all servers allows HTTP/1.0
